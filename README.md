Mobility Cane is a supporting aid used by the visually impaired, to navigate from one place to another. The main purpose of this device is to gain awareness about the surroundings (obstacles, walking path etc.). This works, it has been helping millions for many decades now. But, It can be improved by adding more supportive features.

Some scenarios are listed below where the traditional cane is helpless.
- The cane is dropped, or the person forgets where they put it.
- detecting obstacles above waist level (trees, window doors, wall, sign post etc.)
- The person loses the path and walks towards a road, or takes a wrong turn.
- There is an emergency and there is a complicaiton with the phone, how to contact someone?
- Crossing the road/traffic signal, when no one is around to guide/help.
- Find a shop nearby without any support? how to find the way?
