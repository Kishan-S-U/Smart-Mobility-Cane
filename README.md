Mobility Cane is a supporting aid used by visually impaired people to navigate from one place to another. Why SMART mobility cane ? Lets break it down; First, why do the visually impaired use a mobility cane? To analyse their path and check for obstacles in front of/around them.

is this sufficient? if the objective is just to reach a known place then yes, but this is not always the case, there could be situations where, these people must walk to an unknown place, call someone in an event of emergency, the cane slipped from their hand and they are unable to find it, etc. In these situations, they need help from another person. What if no one is around to help?

This is where our 'SMART' mobility cane can help. This device is equipped with the followning features;
- Distress call [send a message to any emergency contact with the current GPS co-ordinates with just a button press]
- Google map assist [provide destination information to google assistant and the smart cane will guide the user to their destination]
- Find device [device makes a beeping sound if dropped]
